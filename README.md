# Chemical-Engineering-Design-Project-for-Isopropanol-Production
This project presents a comprehensive chemical engineering design for isopropanol production, based on the vapor-phase hydration process. The separation section employs extractive distillation using ethylene glycol to efficiently break the isopropanol–water azeotrope.
